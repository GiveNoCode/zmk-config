## Build firmware

GitHub Actions is used to automatically build the user's configured firmware for them.

1. Push the changes to repository
2. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/GiveNoCode/zmk-config/actions) 
3. Wait for build completion
4. Download artifacts -> firmware.zip


## Flash firmware

1. Enter bootloader (double tap reset)
2. Copy .uf2 firmware (for each half) file to "NICENANO" root folder

## Building Additional Keyboards

You can build additional keyboards with GitHub actions by appending them to `build.yml` in your `zmk-config` folder. For instance assume that we have set up a Corne shield with nice!nano during [initial setup](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup) and we want to add a Lily58 shield with nice!nano v2. The following is an example `build.yaml` file that would accomplish that:

```
include:  
	- board: nice_nano    
	  shield: corne_left  
	- board: nice_nano    
	  shield: corne_right  
	- board: nice_nano_v2   
	  shield: lily58_left  
	- board: nice_nano_v2    
	  shield: lily58_right
```

In addition to updating `build.yaml`, Lily58's shield files should also be added into the `config` sub-folder inside `zmk-config` together with your Corne files, e.g.:

```
corne.conf
corne.keyma
plily58.conf
lily58.keymap
```
